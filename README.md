```
In the video understanding application, the openAI API is working ok, now why do I need the OpenAI api? Also why do I need clause API, 
what is it used for?

You need the OpenAI API for two purposes: (1) generating embeddings (vector representations) of video transcript chunks to 
enable semantic search in Weaviate, and (2) powering the orchestrator agent's reasoning/decision-making; you need the Claude API 
(Anthropic) as an alternative LLM option for the orchestrator agent—CortexON is configured to use Claude 
(see ANTHROPIC_MODEL_NAME=claude-3-7-sonnet in your .env) for agent reasoning because it's often better at complex 
multi-step planning and tool use than GPT models.

## What is CortexON?

Under the hood, CortexON integrates multiple specialized agents that dynamically collaborate to accomplish user-defined objectives. These specialized agents include:

- **Web Agent:** Handles real-time internet searches, data retrieval, and web interactions.
- **File Agent:** Manages file operations, organization, data extraction, and storage tasks.
- **Coder Agent:** Generates, debugs, and optimizes code snippets across various programming languages.
- **Executor Agent:** Executes tasks, manages workflows, and orchestrates inter-agent communications.
- **API Agent:** Integrates seamlessly with external services, APIs, and third-party software to extend automation capabilities.

Together, these agents dynamically coordinate, combining their unique capabilities to effectively automate complex tasks.

## Quick Start Installation

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following required variables:

#### Anthropic API
- `ANTHROPIC_MODEL_NAME=claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key`

Obtain your API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com).

#### Browserbase Configuration
- `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY=your_browserbase_api_key`
- `BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_browserbase_project_id`

Set up your account and project at [Browserbase](https://browserbase.com).

#### Google Custom Search
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key`
- `GOOGLE_CX=your_google_cx_id`

Follow the steps at [Google Custom Search API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview).

#### Logging
- `LOGFIRE_TOKEN=your_logfire_token`

Create your token at [LogFire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire).

#### Vault Integration(OPTIONAL)
- `VITE_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000`
- `VITE_APP_VA_NAMESPACE=your_unique_namespace_id` (format unrestricted, UUID recommended)
- `VA_TOKEN=your_vault_authentication_token`
- `VA_URL=your_vault_service_endpoint`
- `VA_TTL=24h`
- `VA_TOKEN_REFRESH_SECONDS=43200`

This project uses HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Vault for secure secrets management. While you can either self-host Vault or use HCP Vault, we recommend using HCP Vault for the best managed experience. For HCP Vault Dedicated cluster setup, follow the [official HashiCorp documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/get-started-hcp-vault-dedicated/create-cluster).

#### WebSocket
- `VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:8081/ws`

### Docker Setup

1. Clone the CortexON repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheAgenticAI/CortexOn.git
cd CortexOn
```

2. Setup environment variables

3. **Docker Desktop Users (Optional)**: Enable host networking in Docker Desktop settings ([Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/host/)).

4. Build and run the Docker containers:
```sh
